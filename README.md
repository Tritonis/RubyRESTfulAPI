# RubyRESTfulAPI
hackathon ruby wrapper


This is the core ruby file for the capital one test database. It allows other ruby developers to directly access and manipulate the capital one API without messing around with any HTTP requests of any kind. They are handled by the gem. The ruby dev just needs to supply various ID's to the ruby methods(account id, customer id, transaction id, etc.) which are needed to access the correct datdabase records.
